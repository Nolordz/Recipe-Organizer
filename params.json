{"name":"Recipe-organizer","tagline":"","body":"During this week we started to look in to Django and how it works, we created a new project call Recipe Organizer. (the process of creating new virtual environment seems long and complicated, but its not once you follow the right steps).\r\nOn this project we can see how we can manipulate data using python to create models, but first let me explain what is Django.\r\nDJANGO : is a web application frame work,written in python language,  that can be use to create complex data models(websites) in a more easy and friendly way, (Some examples that use django are websites like Mozilla and instagram). \r\nDjango has what is call \"MVC\" framework  , \"Model View Controller\" that uses relation between data models(Known as classes in python) and the database(Models), has also a system that handles and process request (View) with a web templating system, and a URL as a dispatcher (Controller).\r\nWhile we keep learning Django, we keep practicing by solving problems using python, problem number nine gave me lost a grey hairs , it looked complicated ,  I went ahead and write some code to come up for the solution.\r\n(problem was about calculating the square root of a number , then use Newton's method for  recursion to compare, then print the number of instances along with the square root .)\r\nI could not came up with anything, I revise over and over the instructions and compared to my code, until I found the problem....the problem was me !!! , yeap , I realized I was not understanding what kind of logic I needed to apply in order to solve the project, so I went and write down step for step what I wanted the program to do, then create the code for each line one by one , and it worked !!!.\r\nThe lesson that I learned solving this project was, that as developer in order to write code, in order to solve problems, in order to create something, we must understand what we want the program to do, that means before we write anything in the console . I recommend to  sketch  it in a piece of paper , board or anything before put into code .\r\nI'm very exited to be in this class , just in three weeks  I have made a lot of progress, taking  in consideration my computer skills were not that great ,I'm feeling more competent every time.\r\nLooking forward for week four !!\r\nNoe.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
